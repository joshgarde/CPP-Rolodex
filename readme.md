# CPP-Rolodex
A directory service bot for CPP Discord Servers. It's goal is to make navigating
the vast sea of decentralized CPP servers easier for students and make
advertising/discovery easier for server operators.

## But why?
Trying to navigate through multiple Discord servers and invite links to try to
find the resources you're searching for can be frustrating. It can be even more
frustrating when those searches end with dead invite links or dead servers.
CPP-Rolodex intends to help both server operators and students by creating a
list of campus resources in one location. For students this means no more dead
ends looking for resources and for server operators this means an easier time
managing outreach.
